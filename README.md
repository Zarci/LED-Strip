# ledstrip Library: 
## AVR Functions for the WS2812B implemented in C

The ledstrip library acts as a wrapper for [light_ws2812](https://github.com/cpldcpu/light_ws2812), exposing useful color matrix functions.
 - I've also built some examples using this library so you can easily integrate it into your project.
